# baiumbg-Cogs
A bunch of useless (and some questionably useful) cogs for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) (V3)

* **SFX** - Upload and play sounds through Red's voice. TTS included.
* **Duel** - Port of [calebj](https://github.com/calebj/calebj-cogs)'s Duel cog.

## Credits
* [Twentysix26](https://github.com/Twentysix26) and everyone else who has contributed to Red Bot.
* [flapjax](https://github.com/flapjax) - for the original (and most widely-used) implementation of the SFX cog.
* [calebj](https://github.com/calebj) - for the original implementation of the Duel cog.
